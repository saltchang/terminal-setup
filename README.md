## Manual Installation

### Customize Your Configs

To customize your own configs, you can fork this project before the below steps.

### Setup for macOS

#### Install Homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### Install Python & Pipx

```bash
brew install python
brew install pipx
```

### Install Nerd Fonts

Please install at least one of the below fonts for your terminal, [Menlo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/Meslo.zip) is recommended.

- [Menlo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/Meslo.zip)
- [FuraCode](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/FiraCode.zip)

See all [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

#### FiraCode

Fira Code is recommended for your editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

##### macOS

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-fira-code
```

##### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt install fonts-firacode
```

### Clone This Project

It's recommended to put the project under `$HOME/projects/personal`:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/projects/personal
cd $HOME/projects/personal
```

Then clone this project (if you forked it, replace the URL with your own):

- use SSH

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:saltchang/terminal-setup.git
    ```

- use HTTPS

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saltchang/terminal-setup.git
    ```

### Install zsh

#### macOS

*Since **Catalina**, macOS will use zsh as the default shell, so you should have zsh built-in in your system*

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install zsh
```

Then restart your terminal

### Setup the Shell

To setup the shell, just run the installation script:

```bash
cd terminal-setup

./install.sh
```

It will create a soft link from `~/.zshrc` to the one in this project, check `dotfiles/.zshrc`.

Now restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc`, you should see the new face of the shell.

## Customize Your Shell

Run the below command to open your `.zshrc`:

```bash
edit-rc
```

Or use the shortcut to go to the `terminal-setup` repo:

```bash
go-rc-repo
```

Then you can start to customize your shell.

### Font Issues

If you're seeing boxes or question marks instead of special characters in your prompt:

1. Make sure you've installed the recommended fonts (Meslo or FiraCode).
2. Ensure your terminal is set to use one of these fonts.
3. If using iTerm2, go to Settings > Profiles > Text and select the appropriate font.

### Node.js Version Switching Issues

If automatic Node.js version switching isn't working:

1. Make sure asdf is properly installed and configured.
2. Check if you have a `.tool-versions` or `.nvmrc` file in your project directory.
3. Try running `asdf reshim nodejs` after installing a new Node.js version.

For any other issues, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
